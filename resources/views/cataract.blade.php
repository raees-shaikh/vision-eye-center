                    <p>The lens of the eye which is made of water and protein helps focus light into the retina through which visual signals are sent to the brain. Excess of protein building leads to lens blocking. The cloud form on your eye lens due to excess protein reduces vision due to blockage of light passing to the retina. This excess protein built-up which leads to lens blockage is called cataract.</p>
                    <h2 class="h2-heading-custom">Who can have Cataract?</h2>
                    <p>Cataract is considered as a normal process of aging. At our center for cataract treatment we come across patients from the age group of 60 plus.

Should this occur, YAG laser treatment is recommended. The YAG laser is used to create an opening in the clouded membrane, which significantly improves the patient’s vision. It is one of the safest treatments used in ophthalmology. It is painless, requires no anaesthesia or incision, and takes only minutes to complete.</p>

                            <p class="accordion-content show">Patients want to know if they would achieve 20/20 vision
                                after cataract surgery, a surgical procedure to replace their eye lens with an
                                artificial one. This happens when the existing cataract makes the vision cloudy
                                and blurry, usually in older adults. You can have 20/20 vision if you do not
                                have other health conditions, such as corneal scarring, macular scarring and
                                wrinkling, macular degeneration and glaucoma. During cataract surgery, the
                                surgeon replaces the human lens with an artificial lens, which could cause
                                compromised vision when other conditions are present. <br>
                                Patients could be farsighted or nearsighted, but they can use multifocal

                            <p class="accordion-content">In traditional cataract surgery, the surgeon incites the cornea’s side
                                by hand to remove the damaged lens. Next, they insert a probe that breaks the human
                                lens with ultrasonic energy, while another probe brings out the pieces. Finally, using
                                the same incision, they insert the replacement lens and stitch up any cuts. <br>
                                During laser-assisted cataract surgery, the surgeon uses specialised software to
                                create the proper surgical plan using three-dimensional images of the patient’s
                                eye. The design includes the cataract’s length, depth and location and breaks the
                                cataract using a femtosecond laser. As there are no major incisions, the stitches
                                heal themselves.<br>
                                If you compare traditional and laser cataract surgery, you will find that the
                                latter uses a computer-guided laser. This increases the accuracy of the surgical
                                incision by ten times, along with half the amount of ultrasonic energy to break
                                the lens and precise placement of the artificial lens. Using traditional cataract
                                surgery, you experience side effects such as eye discomfort, itchy eyes and
                                blurred vision. However, you will not experience pain with laser cataract surgery. </p>
