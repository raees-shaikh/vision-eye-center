                        <p>The entire femtosecond lase eye surgery procedure takes 10-20 minutes. The exact shape of the cornea is determined through a computer scanning device. Depending on this scan, the amount of tissue removal is calculated. The entire aim is that upon replacing the flap, the individual doesn’t have to depend on eye glasses or contact lenses anymore. This procedure changes the shape of the cornea permanently. A blade, called a microkeratome, is used to cut the cornea flap keeping a hinge at one end of the flap. The middle portion of the cornea, stroma, is revealed by folding the flap. Computer-controlled laser vaporizes a portion of the stroma and the flap is replaced back.</p>
                        <p>The cornea takes proper shape which helps focus light into the retina leading to better improved vision. Dr. Himanshu Mehta brings in years of experience, skill & dedication to offer the best Lasik eye surgery in Mumbai. He has treated thousands of individual patients in Mumbai with success. His Lasik Eye procedure has benefitted individuals across the globe from varied age groups and strata of the society.</p>

                                Does LASIK surgery impact your eyesight?
                            </a>

                            <p class="accordion-content show">Laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis, abbreviated as LASIK, is a refractive surgery. In this procedure, the
                                surgeon cuts a thin fold of tissue from the front of the patient’s eye. A laser burns away the offending
                                tissue to reshape the cornea, which helps the light focus on the retina at the back of their eye. LASIK
                                correct vision problems such as farsightedness, astigmatism and nearsightedness.   <br>
                                Considered to be an effective and safe procedure, the surgeon operates daily. Most patients have 20/20
                                vision, but people experience side effects such as halos, glare, pain or even loss of sight. Some people
                                have even had 20/40 vision, which is suitable for clearing a driver’s licensing examination. </p>

                        <li class="accordion-item">

                                How long does it take to have clear vision after LASIK surgery?
                            </a>

                            <p class="accordion-content">In most cases, patients recover from LASIK surgery six to twelve hours after the surgery. This depends on
                                certain factors, but most patients experience a clearer vision within twenty-four hours after LASIK
                                surgery. Some others would need between two and five days to recover. However, they could also
                                experience vision fluctuations and blurred vision for many weeks after their surgery. <br>
                                As patients have blurry vision immediately after their surgery, we recommend that a family member or
                                friend drive their home after the surgery. Relax and have a nap, but avoid reading or watching television
                                that could stress your eyes. After your procedure, you must return to the clinic to check for vision and
                                take steroid eyedrops and antibiotics for one week. The patient will fully recover after three to six
                                months when the vision finally stabilises.

                                For how long should you wear sunglasses after laser operation?
                            </a>

                            <p class="accordion-content">When performing LASIK surgery, the surgeon cuts a fold of tissue on the top of the patient’s cornea.
                                Next, the top tissue layer is lifted back, which aids in precisely working upon the cornea’s surface. After
                                the surgery is completed, the surgeon lowers the flap back into its position for the tissues to heal.
                                Though LASIK surgery usually does not cause pain, your eyes could be itchy, dry and sensitive to light and
                                the sun. <br>
                                You must wear your sunglasses to guard the eyes after the surgery, as they dim the harsh sunlight to
                                reduce irritation and sensitivity. In addition, they block ultraviolet rays that hamper the healing process
                                and prevent the patients from scratching and rubbing. Excessive scratching disturbs the healing corneal
                                flap and delays the recovery process. <br>
                                You must wear your sunglasses through the recovery processes, especially the first twenty-four hours
                                after LASIK surgery. After a few more days, your eyes would gradually lose their sensitivity, but the
                                patient must wear them when going outdoors in cloudy weather (at least for one month). Even after
                                complete recovery, sunglasses protect the eyes from long-term ultraviolet damage, prevent growth and
                                cataracts.

                            </a>

                            <p class="accordion-content">After your LASIK surgery, the patient would constantly wear specialised goggles to protect the eyes. You
                                must observe eye protection after surgery, as the corneal flap created during surgery is healing. Touching
                                or rubbing the eye during the recovery causes displacement to the flap, which would hamper your
                                vision. Generally, only use light pressure for the initial two weeks, but you can gently rub the eyes after
                                two months.</p>

                            <p class="accordion-content">To protect your eyes after LASIK surgery, wear eye-protective devices for twenty-four hours after the
                                surgery, expect eye irritation and slight redness, use artificial eye drops to lubricate your eyes, maintain
                                your doctor’s appointments and use dark sunglasses to block ultraviolet rays. Don’t watch television, use
                                the computer or read, exercise for a week, drive, use hot tubs and swimming pools for two weeks or
                                apply eye makeup, creams and lotions for a week. Avoid pressure and high-impact activity such as
                                contact sports for two weeks.
