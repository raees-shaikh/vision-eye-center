                        <p>Ptosis Surgery is the most common treatment for childhood ptosis. If amblyopia is present, treatment with patching, eyeglasses, or eye drops may be required. An ophthalmologist must consider a few important factors in determining whether or not eyelid ptosis surgery is necessary and which procedure is the most appropriate:</p>

                                <i class="flaticon-check-mark"></i><li> The height of the eyelids.</li>
                                <i class="flaticon-check-mark"></i><li> Muscle strength for lifting and closing the eyelids.</li>

                        <h4>Ptosis in Adults </h4>
                        <p>Separating or stretching the levator muscle tendon from the eyelid is the most common cause of ptosis in adults. This procedure may take place:</p>
                       <p>Adult ptosis can also be caused by other diseases that affect the levator muscle or its nerve supply, such as neurologic and muscular diseases and, in rare cases, orbital tumours.</p>
                       <h4>Ptosis Treatment for Adults  </h4>
                       <p>If treatment is required, it is typically surgical. A small tuck in the lifting muscle and the removal of excess eyelid skin can sometimes raise the lid sufficiently. More severe ptosis necessitates levator muscle reattachment and strengthening.</p>
