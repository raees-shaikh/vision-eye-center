                    <p>The retina is the innermost layer of the eyes. Our retina consists of millions of light-sensitive cells
                        and nerve cells that receive and organize visual information. The retina sends this visual information
                        to our brain through the optic nerve, allowing us to see. </p>
                    <p>In simple terms, the retina helps to see things around us more clearly, and any problem with the

                    <p>The retinal detachment or retinal tear is caused due to eye injury, aging or other eye conditions. It is
                        a condition wherein fluid gets accumulated under the retina. This usually happens when the fluid
                        passes through the retinal tear and settles beneath it. </p>

                     <p>Retinal detachment is a serious eye condition and requires immediate treatment from a retina
                        specialist doctor in Mumbai to correct the vision. </p>
                    <p>Age-related macular degeneration is one of the leading causes of blindness among people above 65
                        years of age. This is a degenerative, painless and irreversible eye condition of the macula. With age,
                        the arteries that nourish the retina harden, restricting the flow of nutrients and oxygen to the retinal
                        tissue, thus, resulting in the deterioration of vision. </p>
                    <p>Effective treatment methods instituted at Vission Eye Center include VGEF injections and
                        Photodynamic therapy, which improve the flow of oxygen and nutrients to the retina, allowing
                        individuals to experience clear sight. </p>
                    <p>The laser technology is used to treat a multitude of retinal conditions. The process is called retinal
                        photocoagulation, wherein the energy of the light is converted into heat at the minutest level and
                        focused on the retina resulting in the denaturation of protein in the retina.</p>
                    <p>The laser treatment method applied by Vission Care Center acts directly on the vessels of the retina
                        and increases oxygenation of the inner retina. It also helps to rescue or close the leakages, enabling
                        the patient with clear sight.</p>
                    <p>People with a prolonged history of diabetes also suffer from eye conditions induced by the disease.
                        Diabetic Retinopathy is a major eye complication resulting from diabetes. If this condition is not
                        treated, it can degrade your vision, resulting in blindness.</p>
                    <p>Vission Eye Center offers multiple methods of treatment depending on the eye condition. Treatment
                        methods could include: </p>

                            <p class="accordion-content show">Retinal detachment is defined as an immediate situation when the retina, or a thin tissue at the back of
                                your eye, moves away from the original position. This separates the retinal cells from the layer of blood
                                vessels that provide nourishment and oxygen, which increases the risk of permanent blindness. Common
                                symptoms include reduced vision, reduced side vision, flashes of light, blurred vision and floaters before
                                the detachment. <br>
                                The risk of retinal detachment increases if you have previously had retinal detachment, are ageing, have
                                extreme nearsightedness, have a family history of retinal detachment, previous eye injury, and surgery
                                such as uveitis, lattice degeneration and retinoschisis.</p>

                                What are precautions for retinal detachment?
                            </a>

                            <p class="accordion-content">Though you cannot prevent your eyes from retinal detachment, you should undergo regular eye
                                examinations and care to safeguard eye health. Eye examinations are essential, especially if you have
                                myopia or nearsightedness, which increases the chances of retinal detachment. If you notice the
                                symptoms of retinal detachment, visit the ophthalmologist right away. Also, use protective eyewear
                                when you are performing risky activities or playing sports. <br>
                                If you have an increased chance of eye disease, you must go for annual eye examinations. According to
                                your prescription, you should plan the proper eye examination schedule. Eyecare providers use a dilated
                                non-invasive eye examination, along with putting eyedrops to widen or dilate the pupil. Other methods
                                include optical coherence tomography and ocular ultrasound, which diagnoses the problem effectively.</p>

                            </a>

                            <p class="accordion-content">Your retinal treatment depends upon your vision’s condition before the retinal detachment, possible
                                complications and the severity of the case. Though surgery is commonly prescribed, you do have
                                non-surgical options as well. However, surgery is the most preferred medical option.<br>
                                In cyroprxy (freezing) and thermal (laser), the surgeon performs these in the doctor’s cabin itself.
                                Pneumatic retinopexy is suitable for smaller and easier to close tears, where the surgeon injects a small
                                gas bubble into the vitreous gel, which sets against the retina’s upper part to complete the tear. You
                                must hold the head in the prescribed position to enable healing. For the scleral buckle, the surgeon sews
                                an invisible silicone buckle around the sclera which covers the detachment until the tear heals.
                                Vitrectomy repairs more considerable detachment, where the surgeon replaces the eye’s vitreous gel
                                with oil or a gas bubble and requires you to hold a particular head position for a while.</p>

                            <p class="accordion-content">You can improve your retinal health by consuming a balanced and healthy diet, such as fruits, meat, lean
                                fish, eggs and green vegetables. Avoid deep-fried, processed and packaged food as they cause excessive
                                weight gain and high blood sugar. Also, do not consume sugary and carbonated drinks to prevent blood
                                glucose spikes. Instead, consume lots of water to hydrate your body, producing sufficient moisture for
                                your eyes and promoting and purifying blood flow. <br>
                                Exercise regularly to lower the chances of diabetic retinopathy, excessive weight and retinal detachment.
                                Wear sunglasses that control ultraviolet radiation in the sun, workshops and swimming and quit smoking
                                to prevent macular degeneration along with maintaining eye examinations.  </p>

                            <p class="accordion-content">Though there are multiple reasons and risk factors for retinal detachment to occur, the three major
                                causes are: <br>
                                    <span> <b>Exudative:</b> </span>Retinal detachment occurs when the fluid builds up behind the retina without tears, which
                                        pushes the retina away from the underlying tissue. Other factors such as swelling, age-related macular
                                        degeneration, inflammation, injury and blood vessels
                                    <br>
                                    <span> <b>Rhegmatogenous:</b> </span>Retinal detachment is expected in this case, which occurs due to a retinal tear. This
                                        happens because of age because the vitreous gel filling the eyeball pulls away from the retina, which
                                        occurs due to surgery, nearsightedness and eye injury.
                                    <br>
                                    <span> <b>Tractional:</b> </span>Retinal detachment occurs when the scar tissue pulls on the retina due to damaged blood
