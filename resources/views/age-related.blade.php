                    <p>Age related macular degeneration is the leading cause of blindness in those over the age of 65 years and accounts one-third of cases of untreatable vision loss.
                        This is a painless, irreversible, degenerative eye condition of the macula. With age, sometimes there is hardening of the arteries that nourish the retina. This deprives the sensitive retinal tissue of oxygen and nutrients that it needs to function and thrive. This leads to deterioration of central vision.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="h2-heading-custom">There are two major types - </h2>

                        <h2 class="pt-4 h2-heading-custom">Treatment for wet age related macular degeneration</h2>
                        <p>Dry ARMD is generally a silent slowly progressive one. <br>
                            Wet ARMD is associated with vision problems and distortion. Diagnosing this condition in time is the key to prevent any damage or scarring of the macula as the disease progresses.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="pt-4 h2-heading-custom">Photodynamic Therapy</h2>
                       <p>A combination of drugs and laser therapy, a verteporfin photosensitive compound that localizes to the target tissue is injected into a peripheral vein and excited with a laser light of a specific wavelength. Activated verteporfin forms
                        free radicals which coagulate the leaky subretinal vessel responsible for cellular injury.
                        Patients receiving PDT should be advised to avoid sun exposure to the sun and other sources of bright light.
                       </p>

                       <h2 class="pt-4 h2-heading-custom">VGEF Injections</h2>
                       <p>Since the angiogenic role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VGEF) in neovascularization in conditions like wet ARMD, new treatment modalities like anti-VGEF injections are the standard line of treatment.
                            <br>Injections that are available are:
                        </p>

                            <p class="accordion-content show">Though there is no treatment for dry macular degeneration, intraocular
                                injections are the only treatment for wet macular degeneration, such as Eylea, Lucentis
                                and Avastin. If you have already lost your vision, this could restore some of that

                                administers medical injections, high-energy laser light and light-sensitive
                                medications to prevent blood vessels from forming.</p>

                            <p class="accordion-content">To prevent macular degeneration, consume a diet rich in
                                antioxidants, such as vegetables and fruits high in zeaxanthin and lutein. Examples
                                include collard greens, papaya, kiwi, green beans, sweet potatoes, squash, green bell
                                peppers, spinach, kale, oranges, broccoli, peaches, mangoes, lima beans and red
                                grapes. In addition, you should also consume peaches, apricots, orange bell
                                peppers, honeydew melon and yellow corn. <br>
                                Other prevention methods include eye examinations, protecting the eyes from
                                ultraviolet rays, not smoking and taking vitamin supplements. You should also
                                manage other health conditions such as high blood pressure and cardiovascular
                                disease, maintain a healthy weight and include nuts and fish in your diet as
                                they contain omega-3 fatty acids.

                                degeneration, its chances could be increased by environmental and hereditary
                                factors such as diet, obesity and smoking. Being a progressive disease, dry
                                macular degeneration affects the macula, which regulates clear vision in the
                                direct line of sight. <br>
                                As we age, the macular tissue thins and lose cells that maintain sight. Risk
                                factors include the age above sixty, genetics, family history, smoking, race,
                                cardiovascular disease, obesity and high cholesterol. Caucasians, women, those
                                who do not consume vegetables and fruits with light-coloured eyes and skin are

                                birth, childhood, early adulthood and middle age. For example, people with severe
                                myopia are at risk of macular degeneration due to the unusual elongation of the
                                eyeball, which causes bleeding and tears in the retina and macula. However, the
                                chances exponentially increase after the age of sixty. </p>
